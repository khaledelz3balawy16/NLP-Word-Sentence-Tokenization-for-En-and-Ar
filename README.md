Tokenization: A Fundamental Step in NLP
Tokenization is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves breaking down text into smaller components called "tokens." These tokens can be words, sentences, or even characters, depending on the specific application.

In this notebook, we will explore the concept of tokenization, why it is essential, and how it is implemented. We will demonstrate word and sentence tokenization for both English and Arabic text. By the end of this notebook, you will have a clear understanding of how to tokenize text effectively and handle the challenges that arise during the process.
